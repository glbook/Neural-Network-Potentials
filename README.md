when we want to take advantage of neural network in order to construct a potential energy surface (how atoms see their neghbors! and interact with them) we should take into account the symmetrys of the physicsal system, because physicsal systems has a symmetrys and for a promlem such potential energy, we alread know that their are translation, rotation, and permutation symmetrys in which we should take into account.
so for tackeling this symmetry things people
