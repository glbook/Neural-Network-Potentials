When we want to take advantage of a neural network to construct a potential energy surface (how atoms see their neighbors! and interact with them), we should consider the physical system symmetries. We already know that translation, rotation, permutation, and reflection symmetry for a problem such as potential energy should be considered.
People already did different works for tackling these symmetry things. Still, the problem is already out there (and that is the reason why we every day see a lot of creative ways of representing molecular configurations for machine learning).
In this repository, we aim to reproduce those representations (which from now on, we will name fingerprints), and we will try to use different architectures of neural networks to get good accuracy and generalization.
