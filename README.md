# neural network potentials
When we want to take advantage of a neural network to construct a potential energy surface (how atoms see their neighbors! and interact with them), we should consider the physical system symmetries. We already know that we should take translation, rotation, permutation, and reflection symmetry for a problem such as potential energy into account. People already did different works for tackling these symmetry things. Still, the problem is already out there (and that is the reason why we every day see a lot of creative ways of representing molecular configurations for machine learning).

## image method

We will start with the image representation of an atomistic environment, implemented in the below article:
